# KM2 Project
## Next Steps
Build basic Client side react application and begin to add in routes and endpoints server side as needed.
Basically more of a thin-slice agile development method.

**Next:** Add in basic questionnaire section so you can answer each question one at a time and then submit your results (which saves it to the database).
- Submit button
    - Add a time-code of when you took the test
    - Link to server endpoint
- Add in some unit tests...
- Deal with warning about going from unControlled to controlled input
- Ensure that look of questionnaire matches the paper one
- Attempt to make number input look better (increase the width to match the cell?)

**Then:** Login screen with proper [hashed] security.

## General Stuff
- Unit tests!
- Prevent SQL injection
- ~~Add endpoints for each use-case~~
    - ~~with proper checking (verification, permissions, etc)~~
    - ~~With correct REST conventions~~
