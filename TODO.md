# KM2 Project
## Priority
- Add unit tests

## Next Steps
Build basic Client side react application and begin to add in routes and endpoints server side as needed.
Basically more of a thin-slice agile development method.

**Next:** Add in basic questionnaire section so you can answer each question one at a time and then submit your results (which saves it to the database).
- Hide prev/next button when at start/end of options

- Store example text as with the other pages

- Submit button
    - Add a time-code of when you took the test    
    
**Then:** Login screen with proper [hashed] security.

## General Stuff
- Prevent SQL injection
- ~~Add endpoints for each use-case~~
    - ~~with proper checking (verification, permissions, etc)~~
    - ~~With correct REST conventions~~
